Basics of LESS and SASS

I'm learning the most popular css preprocessor and now i want to share with all of you. This repository contains source code basic of Less and Sass syntax with small project web design a landing page. Have fun with modern approach about styling web page. 

Less is a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themable and extendable.

Less.js is released under the Apache 2 License (though there are plans to dual license it). Copyright 2009-2015, Alexis Sellier and the Less Core Team (see about). Boiled down to smaller chunks, it can be described with the following conditions.


**Sass makes CSS fun again**. Sass is an extension of CSS,
adding nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more.
It's translated to well-formatted, standard CSS
using the command line tool or a web-framework plugin.
